- I [name/role] will [action] [with collaborators, if applicable] → [concrete outcome]

For example, one of my tasks could be:

- I [MMJ/mentor/auditor] will [inspect each student's chosen tasks' outcomes at the end of the workshop] [with Leon, if applicable] → [each task is (a) incomplete, (b) partially complete, (c) fully complete]



I, Percy, will work with ZiKai to resolve the issues for running the current project -> the current project could run on my laptop and we will check compatibility on different devices as our client asked.
