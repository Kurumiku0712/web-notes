My name is Dr Hansani Thebuwana and I am your academic mentor this semester, responsible for monitoring your well-being, assessing your assignments, and helping to support your professional development. My focus is on your development of professional skills, including teamwork and communication skills and your understanding of leadership in your placement. I will also aim to help you reflect upon your transition to industry and assist you in developing an understanding of your professional role.

I have been selected as a mentor because of my experience and capacity in professional skills. My background is in chemical engineering and engineering management and my areas of expertise include engineering education, accreditation, and the contextual factors of the engineering profession – the very contexts you are immersed in currently during your internship. I see the engineering profession to transcend technical knowledge and problem-solving skills, where professional skills are essential to the role of engineers and other professionals. I hope that my experience and knowledge will be of benefit to you.

I am a supporter of your professional growth and not a technical advisor, so please speak with your industry supervisor if you require assistance with the technical discipline work during your internship.

To help monitor your well-being, I will be providing feedback on your Engagement Reports and we will be meeting four times during this semester. 

- Our first meeting will be 45 minutes and the latter meetings will be 20 - 30 minutes duration.
- Meetings will be online, via [Zoom](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/zoom).
- Please **download** **the agenda** for our first meeting here: [Meeting 1 Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8PCR6rJLY206BpsKA3QyUcMxKU08QfD/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115451576539607676551&rtpof=true&sd=true)
  - During our first meeting, we will talk about what you are doing in your internship, what you would like to achieve, and the key components of the subject.
  - Please **review the agenda** and ensure you have thought about each item. If you would like to, you can also add items to the agenda and email back to me at least 24 hours before our meeting.
  - Note that you will be setting the agenda for our future three meetings (see Student Guide).
  - Please **email me your position description/job advertisement** before our meeting to help me understand the context of your work. If you do not have a copy, please write a couple of paragraphs explaining what you expect to be doing during your internship.

### Slides内容

Provide the **background** understanding that your audience will  require to understand your topic. This will typically come **from the LMS module** related to your topic and  further reading that you do. Make sure that both presenters have the opportunity to present background content as this forms part of  the mark. 

The presentation  1. Know your material. Using notes is fine, but you should not be reading your presentation.  2. Anticipate a diverse group of students in terms of discipline, background, and experience. Be  prepared to go a little slower or faster as required.  3. Where applicable, anticipate and plan the key questions that students will want answers to. E.g.,  when applying frameworks, work out the answers to each question or step of the framework.  4. Using visuals may help the audience to understand the concepts you aim to deliver. 



**Hazards** are anything that can harm you, and while some may be obvious, such as chemicals and asbestos, others may be less so.



演讲稿

Hello, I'm Percy. I'll be talking about risks. Let’s start with the definition: **Risk refers to the possibility of harm.** There are usually two dimensions to evaluate a risk: **Likelihood** and **Consequence**. We can see from the **risk matrix** here, it shows the **Likelihood** of an event, ranging from "Rare" to "Almost Certain." It also defines the **Consequence** which means the amount of harm, starting from "Incidental" to "Severe". Together, they determine the overall risk level, which is colour-coded. We can use this tool to help us to do a risk assessment. 

**Risk Assessment** is a process to understand hazards and risks so we can make the right decisions. In addition to likelihood and consequence, it is also important to figure out **How hazards may cause harm**. To be specific, we can try to work out a sequence of events, like here on the right side. Consider a customer service officer who interacts face-to-face with customers. One potential hazard in this situation is the risk of **assault**. Looking forward to the control measures for this example, some practical solutions become clearer: A counter area can be designed to make it difficult to reach officers. And aggression management training could be provided  to manage upset customers. By carefully analysing the sequence of events and evaluating risks in detail, we can implement effective controls.

**Controls** are the practices used to manage hazards and risks. They are applied in a structured hierarchy to maximise protection and reliability. Let’s go through each level, starting from the top one:

1. **Elimination**: this is the most effective control. It completely removes the hazard. For example, instead of fixing equipment at a height, bring it down to the ground to work on it safely.
2. Then let's move to **Reduction**, there are basically three types of reduction:
   - **Substitution** means replacing the risks with safter alternatives. 
   - **Isolation**: means to Isolate people from the risks, such as by using restricted access zones. 
   - Or take **Engineering Controls** to Reduce the risks through engineering changes. Like redesigning equipment to make it safer.
3. As for **Administrative Controls**: These include things like training staff and scheduling shifts. While effective, these rely on human behaviour, so they are less reliable than elimination or reduction.
4. In terms of PPE **Personal Protective Equipment**: It is considered the least reliable control. It includes items like gloves, helmets, or safety glasses that protect workers from harm. While essential in many situations, PPE only reduces the impact of hazards and does not address the root cause.

By applying controls, we can address hazards effectively, but risks can still change. That’s where the **Take 5 Safety Check** helps us to ensure continued safety in real-time. 

It is A 5-step procedure. Firstly Stop and walk around: try to find out What will happen while you're working.  Step2: Think about the task details, relevant people, necessary equipment. Then Step3: identify the hazards, and evaluate their risk according to how likely they are going to happen and the potential outcome. After understanding the hazards, implement controls to ensure that you have a safe workplace. If you can't manage the hazards yourself, talk to your team leader, supervisor or safety officers. If all of the hazards have been addressed, you can proceed but keep an eye out in case your controls are not working or your situation changes. That is the last step: Monitor. 

To draw a conclusion, **Knowing how to** **recognise** **hazards,** **analyse** **risks, and manage them correctly is crucial for anyone starting a career.**



### Activity内容

Activity: Analyse a work task and complete a “Take 5”. Discuss any outcomes.

Conducting the activity  

1. Provide clear, easy instructions. Where possible, **include all the requirements of the activity on a  single slide for easy reference**.  
2. To improve engagement, you could **split the participants into smaller groups to come up with  responses to particular questions**. E.g., different groups could be given different assertions to  discuss. This can be time consuming though, so it should be considered carefully.  
3. Interaction tools like Kahoot (https://kahoot.it/) and Poll Everywhere  (https://lms.unimelb.edu.au/learning-technologies/poll-everywhere) may improve engagement.   
4. The goal is not to have the participants come up with a specific ‘correct’ answer or decision, but to  guide them in thinking about the implications of the subtopic by actively engaging in the discussion.  
5. 15 minutes of seminar time is not a lot so be careful about planning too many activities, although it  may help to have an activity in reserve.  
6. Aim to ask open ended questions to encourage deeper consideration.  
7. Case studies should be kept short (key points), so that you can present it in an engaging way to  your audience.  



report1不足之处

you should have focused on one are of this **feedback** and you should have linked your reflection to the **EA competencies** and tried to associate your learnings with a specific competency

Your interpretation should have focused on what the feedback means; for example, why has someone given this feedback to you? What was it about your work that drew the feedback? Why did they feel it was important feedback to give to you?

Evaluated the feedback well and your understanding is clear, however for this section and the interpretation, you should have referred to some literature/theory to help you better understand and analyse the experience. 



I would recommend identifying one specific competency as this will help to focus your reflection and planning ahead.
